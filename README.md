## Welcome to miniterm!

Miniterm is a tiny terminal emulator designed to be used as a personal
portfolio website for developers who are terrible at design.

You can see live and in action at: https://thomaskr.online/ 

It's:

* Super simple - it's just three files of vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* Open-source and super simple to customise!
* Sort of responsive. Kind of. Well...who's using terminal on their phone
 anyway?

## Getting started

* Because it's only three files of HTML, CSS and JS, you can do whatever you
 like with it. I host it on a tiny Flask (Python) application, but you could
  integrate it, really, with anything.

### Prerequisites

Build / install

* There are no build steps.

## Built with

* HTML / CSS / JavaScript.

## Deployment

* There's no deployment, really - you'll need to drop it into whatever stack
 you're going to host it on.

## License

* Free for personal use. I'd love to know what you do with it :)
